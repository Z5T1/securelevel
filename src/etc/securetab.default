# This file is best viewed with a tab width of 4.

# Secure Levels:
#  0   Disabled - securelevel will not attempt to change system settings.
#  1   Light - enable some hardening settings, but avoid enabling any settings
#        that may break stuff; err on the side of functionality/ease of use over
#        security.
#  2   Same as securelevel 1.
#  3   Standard (default) - enable standard hardening settings. Attempt to avoid
#        breaking stuff if possible, but err on the side of security over
#        functionaligy/ease of use.
#  4   Same as securelevel 3.
#  5   Pedantic - enable aggressive hardening settings. This will likely cause
#        some stuff to break.
#  6   Same as securelevel 5.

# Odd numbered securelevels are reserved for use by the distribution
# maintainers; even numbered levels are reserved for customization by the local
